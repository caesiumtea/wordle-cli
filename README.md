# WORDLE: Terminal Edition (unofficial!)
You have 6 tries to guess the secret 5-letter word!
Would you like to read the instructions? (Y/N) y

This game is based on Wordle from the New York Times. The goal is to guess the randomly-chosen secret word, which is 5 letters long, in 6 tries or less.
Just type in your word and press enter to guess!

For each guess, the game will show you how much your letters overlap with the secret word.
Your guess will be shown on the left, and the feedback on the right.

* A capital letter in square brackets like [A] means that you got that letter in exactly the right spot! This equals a green square in the original Wordle.
* A lowercase letter in parentheses like (a) means that this letter does appear in the secret word, but not at this position. This equals a yellow square in the original Wordle.
* A dash - in the feedback means that the letter at this position of your guess does not appear in the secret word at all.
Use the feedback to guide your next guesses!

If you use up all your guesses without finding the word, then the answer will be shown at the end.

Also, there are some special commands you can enter while you're prompted to type a word.
* Type !quit to stop playing.
* Type !help to see these instructions again.
* Type !letters to see a list of letters you have not used in any guesses yet.
Good luck and have fun!
